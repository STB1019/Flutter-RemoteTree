# remote_tree

This application was developed as a test of the Flutter framework. Its purpose is to automatically generate a widgets structure from a .json file.

## How does it work?

At the moment remote_tree allows you to specify different types of sections.
* ImageSection which allow to show images from urls
* WebSection which allow to show a web page (actually also mobile numbers to call as it is implemented)
* PDFSection which allow you to specify pdf from url
* ButtonSection which allow you to specify a group of sections of the types listed above

The basic structure of the app is defined in the "assets / sectionsDiBase.json" file which can be modified to insert new structures.
Future implementations will allow you to specify a .json file via url or from the file system.

## Developers

This app was developed by the members of the IEEE Student Branch of Brescia in the last 3 months of 2020 under the guidance of Andrea Rossi.
